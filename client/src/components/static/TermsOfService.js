                <p>In consideration of participating in activities of the New Haven Native American Church (NHNAC), I agree to read all the information presented in these Terms and Conditions and Waiver of Liability Claims.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I agree to comply with any and all rules and regulations communicated to me about these activities, including but not limited to:</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p><strong>1. I KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR RISKS AND LIABILITY FOR MY PROPERTY LOSS, PERSONAL INJURY, SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH WHICH MAY OCCUR IN CONJUNCTION WITH MY PARTICIPATION IN NHNAC ACTIVITIES; AND I HEREBY FOREVER RELEASE, DISCHARGE AND HOLD NEW HAVEN NATIVE AMERICAN CHURCH AND ITS AGENTS HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIM ARISING FROM SUCH RISKS, EVEN IF ARISING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF NHNAC, ITS MEMBERS, AGENTS, OR OF THIRD PARTIES.<span >&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong>I, on behalf of myself and any minors for whom I am responsible, our heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, hereby waive, release, discharge, and agree not to sue New Haven Native American Church, its officers, directors, members, employees, agents, volunteers, representatives, contractors and subcontractors, sponsors, affiliates, and if applicable, owners and lessors of equipment, installations and premises used for related activities, from any and all claims for damages, injuries, losses, liabilities and expenses which I may have or which may subsequently accrue to me, relating to, resulting from or arising out of my use of NHNAC property and/or participation in any NHNAC programs, events, installations or activities, including any injury or damage to my mental or physical health, to my property, or to that of any other person or property.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>However, if NHNAC files a claim against me, I may file a counterclaim related to the same facts and circumstances.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I agree to indemnify, defend and hold the releases harmless from and against any and all claims by third parties for damages, injuries, losses, liabilities, and expenses relating to, resulting from or arising out of my use of NHNAC property or activity, including any program, event or activity at other locations.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I intend that the Waiver of Liability Claims shall be construed broadly to provide a release and waiver to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law.</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>2. I understand that children under 18 years of age can participate in NHNAC activities only when accompanied by a parent or guardian.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If I bring a minor, I agree to the provisions contained in these Terms and Conditions and Waiver of Liability Claims on behalf of the minor.</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>3. I acknowledge and understand that by participating in NHNAC activities, I may be exposed to environments that may present risks of serious injury, permanent disability, death, property damage, economic losses, emotional or psychological disturbance, and other risks, including but not limited to, those caused by:</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>(a) the actions, inactions or negligence of New Haven Native American Church, its agents, Members, or third parties;</p>

                <p>(c) conditions of the premises or equipment used;</p>
                <p>(d) all dangers to persons and property associated with vehicular traffic;</p>
                <p>(e) hot and cold-water temperatures in sweat lodges and immersion pools that are contraindicated for anyone who might be pregnant and might be contraindicated for people with blood pressure or other health issues;</p>
                <p>(f) infection from pools, streams, kitchen facilities or other human-impacted or natural conditions;</p>
                <p>(g) drowning in pools or natural bodies of water;</p>

                <p>(m) wild animals including biting insects, venomous spiders and snakes, bears, mountain lions, and so forth.</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>I further acknowledge and understand that there may also be other risks both obvious and that are not obvious, known, or foreseeable at this time.</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>3. I understand that some NHNAC activities may include sacramental ingestion of psychoactive naturally occurring substances that may have undesired side effects, including but not limited to:</p>
                <p>(a) nausea and vomiting;</p>
                <p>(b) mental illness episodes;</p>
                <p>(c) impaired bodily movement;</p>
                <p>(d) inability to safely drive or operate other machinery;</p>
                <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p>4. Should I find that any condition or activity at NHNAC property or events is unsafe or offensive to me or to any minors accompanying me, I acknowledge that I can avoid such condition or activity by, among other things, leaving the vicinity.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I agree not to leave NHNAC property if I am under the influence of any psychoactive substance.</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>5. Unless I am known to be in possession of a valid health care directive to the contrary, I consent to have first aid and medical treatment that may be deemed advisable in the event I am incapacitated due to injury, accident and/or illness while on NHNAC property or engaged in NHNAC activities.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I release NHNAC and all persons participating in any first aid or medical treatment from all liability for any such actions unless they are grossly negligent.</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>Whereas: the New Haven Native American Church is the &quot;Spiritual Family&quot; of the President of the Church, through the ancient principle of &quot;Making Relations&quot;, which the Church also calls &quot;Spiritual Adoption&quot;, and it is through this religious practice that I request Spiritual Adoption by the President of the Church, and;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>Therefore: By this request I state that (1) Natural Healing is a part of my Spiritual Orientation; (2) I will live by the practice of &ldquo;First, Do Good&rdquo;; (3) I will faithfully study the spiritual and traditional healing materials put out by the New Haven Native American Church, or their assigned, and such education will be under the direction of the President of the Church, by and through means he/she sees fit, and which is upheld by the Constitution and the Church&#39;s Code of Ethics; (4) in accordance with the Constitution of the Church, I covenant to make donations from out of my surplus, so that my gift may assist in supporting the programs of the Church, in whatever amount my stewardship allows and Spirit directs to me as appropriate to my situation in life.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My offerings are free-will donations given in the spirit of the Sacred Giveaway which is bona fide Ceremony and Traditional Practice of the New Haven Native American Church; (5) I will strive to establish a Lodge in my area, if no Lodge already exists here, and/or I will dedicate time, talent and resources, as dictated by the Creator to me, to developing and forwarding the work of my local Lodge.</p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>As a member of the Church, I promise to follow the Ethical Code and Constitution of the Church.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p><strong>I understand that the New Haven Native American Church allows individuals to exercise the freedom the Creator has given them to follow the dictates of religion according to how they feel directed by the Spirit.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong>I also understand that this is not &quot;Tribal Adoption&quot; for purposes of commerce or taxation.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is the first step in the Ceremony of &quot;Making Relations&quot; which the Church calls &quot;Spiritual Adoption&quot; and it is the only manner in which a person may become a Member of the Church. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><br /></p>
                <p>BY SIGNING UP ON <a href="https://NEWHAVENNATIVEAMERICANCHURCH.ORG"><span>NEWHAVENNATIVEAMERICANCHURCH.ORG</span></a> I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND WAIVER OF LIABILITY CLAIMS.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I UNDERSTAND THAT ALONG WITH GAINING THE BENEFITS OF NHNAC ACTIVITIES I ALSO GIVE UP SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS, AND I DO SO KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WITHOUT ANY COERCION OR DURESS.</p>
